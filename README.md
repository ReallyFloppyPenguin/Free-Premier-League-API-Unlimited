<h1>Premier League API 2.0</h1>
	<p>This is an unofficial Premier League API client for pulling player stats, fixtures, tables, and results data from the Premier League. The API is built using Flask, and the data is scraped from the Premier League website.</p>

>We have hosted it onto vercel here (

<p>Thank to https://github.com/tarun7r for the original code</p>

<h2>Setup Details</h2>

### Local Development
Follow the following instructions to run the application locally:
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Open the terminal, navigate to the folder where your clone of this repository is located and type:
  
  `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` </li>

<li> Type $ python main.py in the terminal and the script will run for as long as you let it. </li>

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
This API is now optimized for Vercel serverless deployment:

<li>Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`</li>
<li>Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder</li>
<li>Run `vercel` in the terminal and follow the prompts</li>
<li>Your API will be deployed to a Vercel URL (e.g., https://your-project.vercel.app)</li>

### API Endpoints (Vercel)
Once deployed on Vercel, use these endpoints:
- `GET /api/players/{player_name}` - Get player statistics
- `GET /api/fixtures` - Get all fixtures  
- `GET /api/fixtures?team={team_name}` - Get fixtures for specific team
- `GET /api/table` - Get Premier League table
- `GET /` - API documentation and welcome message
